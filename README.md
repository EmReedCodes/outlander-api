# My Outlander-API
I never did find any good API's for a few of my favorite books, so decided to create my own!

**Link to project:** https://outlander-char-api.herokuapp.com/

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, Javascript, Node, Express, Heroku

I created an API server side and connected it to Heroku. For the API information it is an object with nested objects and arrays. The source of the information I used for this API was [Wiki fandom](https://outlander.fandom.com/wiki/Outlander_Wiki).

## Optimizations

-add better endpoints

-add more characters


## Lessons Learned:

Need to be consistent with puncuation. If I capitalize one set of information I need to do that for all the rest in that category. Create keys that are descriptive and make sense. It will be easier for the user to navigate the data.
